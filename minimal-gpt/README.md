## Minimal GPT Implementation (from scratch)

This project is a **minimal, learning-oriented implementation** of a GPT-like
language model built entirely from scratch.

The goal of this project is **conceptual and implementation-level understanding**
of Transformer-based language models, rather than performance or production use.

### Motivation
Before relying on large pretrained models, this experiment was conducted to:
- Understand the internal structure of GPT-style Transformers
- Implement the full training and generation pipeline manually
- Observe how data scale and generation parameters affect model behavior

### Scope
- Token-based language modeling
- Autoregressive Transformer architecture
- Training loop and checkpointing
- Text generation with configurable parameters

### Notes
This implementation is intentionally minimal and small-scale.
It serves as a foundation-level experiment to clarify how modern LLMs work
and why large-scale training is necessary for practical performance.
